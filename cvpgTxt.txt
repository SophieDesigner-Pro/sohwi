Ever wondered what UX 
with a smile looks like? :D

Sohwi Park

I BUILD CLEAN, INTUITIVE INTERFACES.
I BRING EMPATHY, LOGIC — 
AND HUMAN-CENTERED SOLUTIONS.

If you'd like to learn more, 
feel free to reach out.

Supervised by my cat butler, 
I turn logic into delight.

What I Do
I design digital products that feel intuitive. 
UX research, UI design, and strategy are 
my toolkit. I prototype like I mean it.

Where I Started
I used to manage export deals 
across the globe. Now I manage design systems with just as much care. Turns out, empathy works 
in both fields.

What I’m Like
Quietly curious, deeply observant, 
and visually organized. I’m the one
sketching wireframes during snack breaks. Fluent in English, Korean, 
and design-ish.

Let’s Talk
Like what you see? I’d love to connect. 
I enjoy smart questions, weird ideas, and good feedback. Also: I never say no to a Figma jam.
